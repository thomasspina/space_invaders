# space_invader
A simple recreation of the space invaders game that I made in Java.
There are still a few bugs mainly to do with the alien movement and the sound sometimes glitching but I had to wrap this project up, perhaps I will fix them at a later date.

In order to run the game you simply have to download the .jar file and the 'res' folder. Place them both in the same directory and run the .jar file.

All sounds from https://freesound.org/

All graphics made with https://www.piskelapp.com/
